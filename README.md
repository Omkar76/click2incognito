# click2incognito

Chrome extension to open clicked link in new incognito window.

Inspiration for this extension was a post on [r/chrome](https://reddit.com/r/chrome) where OP was looking for a keyboard shortchut to open a link in incognito instead of using context menu of a link.

I have built this extension using bolerplate code from https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/

## Installation
- Clone or download this repo
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Enable Developers mode in top right corner
- Click **load unpacked** and select the downloaded/cloned directory

## Usage
Hold <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd> and click on any link. It'll be opened in incognito window.
